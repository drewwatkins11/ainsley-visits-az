## Packing List

In general, Arizona has a pretty laid-back dress code. The first time I visited for my college orientation, my dad and I were going to a nice steakhouse for dinner and asked the concierge at the hotel what we should wear. He laughed and said that "Arizona casual" is the fanciest one gets outside of a formal event (ie. jeans and a button down for men; a dress or jeans and a nice top for women). For most breweries and other places we'll visit, pretty much anything goes.

[ ] 1-2 Casual outfits for breweries, etc. (shorts/tank top/sundress)
[ ] Casual outfit for going out at night (ie. jeans or shorts and a nice top, similar to my birthday. If we spend the night in Prescott, it'll get down into the 50s.)
[ ] Nice-ish outfit/dress (Something suitable for an upscale dinner, yet cool enough to wear outside on a hot evening. Even better if it's a bit "spicy" or has a hispanic flair to it.)
[ ] Swimsuit
[ ] Hiking clothes
[ ] HIking boots
[ ] Water shoes (if doing Superstitions)
[ ] Warm clothes/Columbia jacket/hat/gloves (only if camping... plan on 40 degrees at night and a high of 70)
